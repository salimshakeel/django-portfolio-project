## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to create robust and scalable web applications quickly. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a lot of built-in functionalities such as:

- An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.
- An admin interface for managing application data.
- User authentication and authorization.
- URL routing and request handling.
- Form handling and validation.
- Template engine for rendering HTML.

Django emphasizes reusability, rapid development, and the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY).
